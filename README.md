# Smoothing algorithms, and derivative mthods for ShapeFit

Authors: Katayoon Ghaemi, Nils Schoeneberg

This repository provides a code with necessary tools for analyzing the matter power spectrum of the large scale structures of the universe using ShapeFit.
ShapeFit was introduced by Samuel Brieden in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.07641.


This work includes thirteen different smoothing algorithms implemented from the literature, and eleven different derivative methods for calculating the ShapeFit parameter, m,
slope of the power spectrum at pivot scale.
Two post-processing methods are also introduced which aim to remove the residual BAO wiggles and enhance the robustness of the parameter compression for ShapeFit.

Description of all the classes, and functions used in the code can be found here: https://katayoongh.github.io/ShapeFitSmoothing/
